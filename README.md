# ASL Sign Language Prediction App

This Streamlit app captures ASL (American Sign Language) signs using a webcam and predicts the corresponding sign using a TensorFlow Lite model. It visualizes the captured sign and provides real-time predictions.

## Installation and Setup

To run this app locally, you'll need to install the necessary packages and set up the environment:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pavannn29/ASL.git
   cd ASL
   
2.Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the Streamlit app:
  ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
  ```
  
Set the duration (in seconds) for capturing the ASL sign.

Click the "Predict Sign" button to capture the sign and receive a prediction.

The captured sign and prediction will be displayed.
